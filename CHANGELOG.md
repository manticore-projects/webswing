**Fix XSS vulnerability in FileTransferHandlerImpl file upload error message**

* Sanitize user-controlled filename before writing it to HTTP response to prevent XSS attacks. 
* ## Changes 
* - Added &#x60;escapeHtml()&#x60; helper method to sanitize HTML special characters (&#x60;&amp;&#x60;, &#x60;&lt;&#x60;, &#x60;&gt;&#x60;, &#x60;&quot;&#x60;, &#x60;&#x27;&#x60;) 
* - Applied HTML escaping to the &#x60;filename&#x60; variable in the file size error message on line 154 
* ## Why 
* The &#x60;filename&#x60; parameter originates from user-uploaded file metadata and was being written directly to the HTTP response without sanitization. An attacker could craft a malicious filename containing JavaScript (e.g., &#x60;&lt;script&gt;alert(&#x27;XSS&#x27;)&lt;/script&gt;.txt&#x60;) that would execute in the victim&#x27;s browser when the file size error is displayed. HTML-escaping the filename ensures that any special characters are rendered as text rather than interpreted as HTML/JavaScript. 
* ## Semgrep Finding Details 
* Untrusted input could be used to tamper with a web page rendering, which can lead to a Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. XSS vulnerabilities occur when untrusted input executes malicious JavaScript code, leading to issues such as account compromise and sensitive information leakage. To prevent this vulnerability, validate the user input, perform contextual output encoding or sanitize the input. 
* @18080123 requested Semgrep Assistant generate this pull request to fix [a finding](https://semgrep.dev/orgs/andreas_manticore_projects_com/findings/733627377) from the detection rule [java.servlets.security.servletresponse-writer-xss-deepsemgrep.servletresponse-writer-xss-deepsemgrep](https://semgrep.dev/r/java.servlets.security.servletresponse-writer-xss-deepsemgrep.servletresponse-writer-xss-deepsemgrep).
